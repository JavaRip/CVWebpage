            <p>The purpose of this project was to match users to jobs based on a questionnaire
            the user has previously filled out using a recommender system via content filtering.</p>
            <p>This was a fun role because it required designing a web app completely from scratch.</p>
            <p>During this project, I developed my skills in front end usability design and
            gained strong foundational skills for recommender systems development.</p>

            <p>This project aims to help people in Bangladesh who drink from wells determine if their
            well water is safe.</p>
            <p>It does this by using an environmental model to predict the levels of arsenic in the well
            based on its location and appearance.</p>
            <p>Working on this project has been an amazing privilege and has massively developed my skills
            in JSON data processing and geodata visualization.</p>
