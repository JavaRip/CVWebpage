            <p>This was a very dynamic and challenging role focused around higher level
            design decisions and implementations where the ability to implement these
            designs was taken for granted</p>
            <p>My skills as a project manager were greatly developed as were my practical
            programming skills in cloud computing methodologies and artificial intelligence
            solutions for an enterprise enviornment</p>

            <p>The purpose of this project was to match users to jobs based on a questionnaire
            the user has previously filled out using a recommender system via content filtering.</p>
            <p>This was a fun role because it required designing a web app completely from scratch.</p>
            <p>During this project, I developed my skills in front end usability design and
            gained strong foundational skills for recommender systems development.</p>

            <p>This project aims to help people in Bangladesh who drink from wells determine if their
            well water is safe.</p>
            <p>It does this by using an environmental model to predict the levels of arsenic in the well
            based on its location and appearance.</p>
            <p>Working on this project has been an amazing privilege and has massively developed my skills
            in JSON data processing and geodata visualization.</p>

          <p>Note that as well as the sorting algorithm being visualized, you can also click the Enable Sound
          button before starting to also hear the algorithms do their thing.</p>
